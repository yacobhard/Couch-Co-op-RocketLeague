Rocket league co-op is locked to the max resolution of one monitor by default.

Using this script you can extend the resolution & make changes to other settings that permit Rocket league to span the X resolution of however many monitors you require

TO RUN
Change the variable value to match the location of your 'TASystemSettings.ini' file
(In my case is C:\Users\Jake\Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\Config)

You must also change your rocket league settings to display co-op mode vertically.
